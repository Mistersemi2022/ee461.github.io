 Super-Capacitor Degradation Study Using Neural and Non-neural Approaches 
 
About the this Project

This Project was basically utilizing machining learning techniques to analyze the performance and aging of Super-capacitor using the data extracted from 113 Super-capacitor experimentally.

 
Introduction 

Machine learning is a quick and accurate method for material prediction that extracts complex physical and chemical properties from data by representing properties with important descriptors. Despite recent advancements, two significant difficulties have frequently prevented the application of material prediction: firstly, machine learning requires sufficient data to capture the correlation features of the material; and secondly, its prediction is highly susceptible to the distribution of the data set [1]. Machine learning is significant because it helps in the development of new products and provides a picture of trends in behavior and operational patterns [2]. Today, machine learning is used in a wide range of applications. One of the most powerful applications is known as the recommendation engine, which is used on Facebook. A recommendation engine, commonly referred to as a recommender system, is software that examines the data at hand to offer recommendations. There are many techniques that use machine learning tools to analyze data, such as linear regression (LR), principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, and the list goes on.

Linear regression is one of the powerful techniques used in data analysis. It is a common type of predictive analysis. It does two common things: it sets a predictor variable and identifies the variable, in particular the significant predictors of the outcome variable. Furthermore, regression analysis has three main applications: assessing predictor power, predicting an effect, and predicting trends. Ren proposes linear regression as one of his methods used to predict super capacitor degradation. His method was described that specify the output is linear to the input. This project will utilize machine learning techniques and neural and non-neural techniques, to study super capacitor degradation mechanisms. 
 
Objectives

1.    To analyze, preprocess the raw the raw data, create mat file (preparing the data for analysis)

2.    To analyze the data geometry by using scatter plot, Pareto chart correlation 

3.    Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA.

4.    Utilize the linear regression for training and testing for the degradation study 

5.    Finally use the ANN to predict the cycle of  super-capacitor
